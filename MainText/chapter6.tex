\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap-6}

A brief summary of this work:
%
\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item The continued study of self-consistent phase space distributions, particularly the Danilov distribution, was motivated.
    %
    \item The dynamics of the Danilov distribution in linear focusing systems with space charge were investigated using envelope equations. An iterative algorithm was developed to find the matched solution in coupled or uncoupled focusing systems. The matched solution in the SNS was calculated and the signifcance of the calculation was discussed.
    %
    \item A previous simulation of elliptical painting in the SNS was revisited, plotting the intrinsic beam emittance as a function of time and displaying all 1D/2D projections of the distribution in one figure.
    %
    \item Methods to measure the four-dimensional phase space distribution were implemented in the SNS. The first method was to used 1D projections from wire-scanners. The machine optics were adjusted to reduce the sensitivity to errors and minimize the measurement time. The second method was to use 2D projections on the target to reconstruct the phase space distribution. 
    %
    \item An injection method called elliptical phase space painting was carried out for the first time in the SNS. The resulting distribution was measured and compared to simulations with updated experimental constraints. In the final experiment, the measured four-dimensional emittance was reduced relative to a distribution produced by normal injection methods.
\end{itemize}

Work will continue at the SNS. It may be possible to increase the maximum injection angle by modifying the foil position, orbit corrector dipoles, Chicane dipoles, or HEBT trajectory, which would allow a larger beam to be painted and potentially allow elliptical painting at the nominal beam energy of 1 GeV. There may also be some use for the skew quadrupole correctors in the ring to reduce the current required large angular kicks. Additionally, solenoids will be installed in the SNS ring in the late 2022. This should stabilize the distribution against nonlinearities and reduce the sensitivity to the tune split in the ring. If the beam is measured and found to be close to a self-consistent Danilov distribution, it will be measured as it is stored in the ring after injection to determine its stability. Such experiments could address some of the questions listed in \cite{Burov2013} about the use of circular modes in a collider. 

Diagnostics can also be improved. The electron-scanner, which has the ability to measure turn-by-turn 1D projections of the distribution in real time, will be recommissioned soon; although the phase space distribution cannot be reconstructed from these projections, they can be compared to the projections of a uniform density ellipse. For the beam images on the target, it would be ideal to use a camera instead of a fiber bundle and to eliminate the effect of the fiducial markers to produce a cleaner image. Additionally the methods described in Chapter \ref{chap-4} can be used to reconstruct the 4D phase space distribution from the target images; unfortunately, a quality set of beam images was not collected in this work. 

Related research problems may be pursued in the future. For example, it may be possible to design a lattice with so-called ``circular mode optics" that keep the beam as round as possible throughout the ring, with a very small 4D emittance, to minimize the space charge tune shift. This problem is currently being investigated in a collaboration between the SNS, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory \cite{Morozov-forthcoming}. Parallel design studies could be performed to optimize the injection region for elliptical painting. Realistic simulations of elliptical painting should be carried out with such an injection region; losses should be compared to simulations of correlated and/or anti-correlated painting, especially as the beam intensity is scaled, to see if elliptical painting could outperform these methods. 

There are also theoretical problems related to the Danilov distribution and/or self-consistent distributions in general. The stability properties of the envelope equations, studied in detail for the KV distribution in \cite{Lund2004}, have not yet been studied specifically for the Danilov distribution. There will be so-called odd modes, or tilting modes, due to the cross-plane correlation in the beam. A framework to study the stability of all second-order modes was presented in \cite{Yuan2017}. 3D envelope equations have also been studied using the KV model \cite{Qiang2018}, but they are not closed since the KV distribution does not exist in three spatial dimensions; several self-consistent distributions were derived in three spatial dimensions in \cite{Danilov2003}, and the resulting closed set of 3D envelope equations may be of interest. Finally, the high-order coherent instabilities present in the KV distribution can be investigated numerically for the Danilov distribution and/or other self-consistent distributions.
