\textbf{Cavity Induced Transparency} — Phenomenon in which a cavity containing two atoms excited with light at a frequency halfway between the atomic frequencies contains the number of photons an empty cavity would contain.  

\textbf{Dipole Blockade} — Phenomenon in which the simultaneous excitation of two atoms is inhibited by their dipolar interaction.
