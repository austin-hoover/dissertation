Self-consistent phase space distributions are equilibrium solutions to the Vlasov equation that give rise to linear space charge forces under any linear transformation. This dissertation investigates whether one such distribution — the Danilov distribution — could be physically realized using a method called elliptical painting, particularly in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). In addition to the interesting theoretical properties stemming from its self-consistent nature, the vanishing four-dimensional emittance of the Danilov distribution makes it potentially useful for colliders and beam cooling applications.

First, the dynamics of the Danilov distribution were studied using envelope equations. Second, particle-in-cell simulations of elliptical painting in the SNS were carried out. Both studies resulted in an improved understanding of the beam dynamics and placed constraints on experiments. Third, methods were implemented to measure the similarity between a painted beam in the SNS and a Danilov distribution. Finally, elliptical painting was performed in the SNS. The measured four-dimensional emittance was significantly reduced relative to a typical beam. Planned modifications to the SNS are expected to bring the beam closer to a self-consistent state.
